# Retention-Based-Customer-Segmentation-ML
This project develops a machine learning solution for customer segmentation using rentention behavior. We cluster customers into groups based on their retention rate and classify new customers into one of the groups. The project aims at using this solution for demand prediction and targeted customer care for better retention. We use data sets from two different application domains - (i) E-commerce and (ii) Telecom. We use both R and Python for data cleaning, EDA and ML. 
# TODO - Data sets (path and explanation of features)
